This is a huge week for fantasy owners to hit the waiver wire. A key pick up like Tim Hightower or Tyler Lockett could pay off!
Tim Hightower expected to remain lead runner
With Mark Ingram out, Tim Hightower performed admirably in his place.

Didn't expect that. Bryce Brown now the guy you want to get your claim in on for your fantasy football teams.
Bolden and Bryce Brown just saw their stock rise. Not to mention James White who should be on a fantasy squad already #FantasyFootball
Fantasy owners - if you need a running back this week, put in a claim for Bryce Brown...

"I expect [Adrian Peterson] to get over 15 fantasy points."- @Akbar_Gbaja
Or on a positive note God please make sure cam newton destroys every passing record Sunday that fantasy money looking pretty real...
Cam Newton is pretty much getting me the majority of my fantasy points
One stat defines Cam Newton's dominance at running the football http://www.rightrelevance.com/search/articles/hero?article=904054789f65e8b7303af3c133e6b9ff28784cd5&query=fantasy%20football&taccount=fantasyfbrr ‚Ä¶
Cam Newton is everyone's best bet to getting points In their fantasy league
#NFLvideos | DeAngelo Williams a good start in Week 15 fantasy http://dlvr.it/D1VZ2K  Watch Now!
@adowler17 oh true. My fantasy luck changed after picking up Deangelo Williams haha.
Deangelo Williams will prove to be the pickup that will lead me to a fantasy championship, coming through huge!
Doug Baldwin and DeAngelo Williams have legit been my BEST two fantasy football free agent pick ups this year!
DeAngelo Williams leads the league in undeserved touchdowns
The only reason I won in fantasy this week is bc Khaled said Antonio brown is a MAJOR key to success
According to @adamrank, Antonio Brown will deliver big for your fantasy teams. #FantasyPriceIsRight 
Ben-Brown, Dalton-Green, Bortles-Robinson among top Week 14 stacks. Roundup for @RotoBaller: http://www.rotoballer.com/week-14-daily-fantasy-football-stacks-dfs-nfl-picks-for-draftkings-fanduel/291604 ‚Ä¶ #FantasyFootball #DFS
Don't get me wrong, Antonio Brown was the best fantasy pick I've ever made...but this man needs a new hair dresser
If you had Antonio Brown or Big Ben on your fantasy team...you had a nice night. http://ow.ly/VzHEH
Because of Antonio Brown's last TD from last night, I won my fantasy game that I once trailed 10-78 by 10+ points, and took over first place
Antonio Brown's punt return gave me the win in fantasy by 1 point üòé
Antonio brown is on one of my fantasy teams so I should be celebrating the way he did last night with that goalpost
