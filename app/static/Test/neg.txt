Mark Ingram going to the IR was a blessing in disguise for my fantasy team.
I liked my fantasy football team coming out of a first round bye. Now I just lost Lagarette Blount & Mark Ingram and maybe Yeldon too. Smh.
Injuries ended my fantasy season horribly by 1pt...Shout out to Andy Dalton, Mark Ingram & Vincent Jackson smh 
So far I've lost Jamal Charles, Mark Ingram & Thomas Rawls to IR on my fantasy team this year😐
My fantasy RB's this season.. Mark Ingram: Out. Thomas Rawls: Out. Demarco Murray: Garbage.
When your fantasy team falls apart at the end #DangIt #AndyDaulton #MarkIngram
This fantasy season I have lost LeVeon Bell, Dion Lewis, Mark Ingram, and now Thomas Rawls
Alfred Blue, the guy who I almost drafted in fantasy, had zero rushes tonight. Yikes. #NEvsHOU
Alfred Blue making a lot of fantasy owners blue tonight.
When you need three points to win your fantasy football playoff matchup, but Alfred Blue doesn't get a single carry. Thanks, bro.
Seahawks cut DuJuan Harris, so don't sign him in fantasy!  I'd go Denard Robinson, then Bryce Brown
How will Dalton, Rawls injuries impact the fantasy production for #Bengals & #Seahawks? Post at @ESPNFantasy: http://es.pn/1IUtTvc 
Sure I am upset that Thomas Rawls is hurt for fantasy purposes, but do I tweet about it? Absolutely not. I'm above that.

Phillip Rivers has failed to throw a TD in 3 of his last 4 games and has failed to reach 10 fantasy points in those same 3
Phillip Rivers went from a fantasy machine to just awful, thanks Phillip, probably gonna cost me in the playoffs
Shoutout to Phillip Rivers for having back to back Screw-my-fantasy-team weeks
Could've used Phillip Rivers getting more than 6 points and Travis Benjamin playing even a little in fantasy this week.

Phillip Rivers is the most inconsistent fantasy QB in the world
Phillip Rivers is one of the most frustrating players to have on your fantasy team!! Pick which QB you wanna be Phillip!!

Shane Vereen cost me my fantasy playoffs
I hate fantasy football and Shane Vereen. #Kanye2020
Giants | Orleans Darkwa, Shane Vereen do little: New York Giants RB Orleans
Uncle Benny's slaves Cut Shane Vereen RB (NYG}
Yes drop Moncrief for him
My fantasy season was so bad that two of my players had lacerated kidneys and I drafted Matt Ryan. #SeasonOfRegrets
Matt Ryan as a fantasy qb, never happening again
Matt Ryan is the waste of a fantasy football life
Matt Ryan is seriously so bad he might have cost me my fantasy season just cause I have Julio and Freeman
Matt Ryan and Julio Jones led me to 9-0 in Fantasy this season then crushed my hopes and dreams on the back half.
